# Fruit-Vegetable-Identifier
Machine learning application created to distinguish between a variety of fruits and vegetables. Based on Tensorflow and using the CIFAR-100 database for training images, this program accepts user-inputted images through a Tkinter GUI and identifies them by type of food.  

Due to size limitations, the CIFAR-100 training data cannot be included in this repository. Download the CIFAR-100 python version from https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html and extract the files into a folder named cifar-100-python placed in the root directory of the project.
