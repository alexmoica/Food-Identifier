# Food-Identifier
Machine learning application created to distinguish between a variety of fruits and vegetables. Based on Tensorflow and using the CIFAR-100 database for training images, this application identifies user images, entered through a Tkinter GUI, by food type.

Due to size limitations, the CIFAR-100 training data cannot be included in this repository. Download the CIFAR-100 python version from [here](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-100-python.tar.gz) and extract the files into a folder named `cifar-100-python` placed in the root directory of the project.

You might need to pip install the following packages: numpy, tensorflow, pillow, opencv-python

To run the program execute the `ccGUI.py` file

Updated to use python 3
